/**
 * \mainpage NVIDIA Inband Frame Readback (NVIFR).
 * NVIFR is a high performance, low latency API to capture and optionally compress
 * framebuffer. Both named (non-zero) framebuffers and the window-system provided
 * an individual DirectX RenderTarget. The output from NvIFR does not include any 
 * window decoration, composited overlay, cursor or taskbar; it provides solely the
 * pixels rendered into the RenderTarget, as soon as their rendering is
 * complete, ahead of any compositing that may be done by the windows manager.
 * In fact, NvIFR does not require that the RenderTarget even be
 * visible on the Windows desktop. It is ideally suited to application capture
 * and remoting, where the output of a single application, rather than the
 * entire desktop environment, is captured.
 *
 * NvIFR is intended to operate inband with a rendering application,
 * either as part of the application itself, or as part of a shim layer operating
 * immediately below the application. Like NvFBC, NvIFR operates
 * asynchronously to graphics rendering, using dedicated hardware compression
 * and copy engines in the GPU, and delivering pixel data to system memory with
 * minimal impact on rendering performance.
